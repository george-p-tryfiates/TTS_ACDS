# TTS_ACDS
This is a readme for the Tech Talent South/Arkansas Center for Data Science program.

In this repo, I have notes, projects, and external data science resources.

I have a B.S. in Mathematical Economics. I have done numerous econometric (quantitative analysis) projects. 
I also completed the TTS Data Science with Python class with Marissa Robinson. We built Python and R machine learning projects as well as programs practicing OOP and other Python concepts.
We also built a webscraper.
